about: Report a Source Present in Tachiyomi/Mihon and Kotatsu that Fails to Convert
title: ''
labels: bug
assignees: ''

---

- [ ] I have checked that the source is implemented in the [Kotatsu parsers repo](https://github.com/KotatsuApp/kotatsu-parsers)
- [ ] I have tried force updating the sources (`nekotatsu update --force-download`)
- [ ] (OPTIONAL) The source is listed by [Keiyoushi](https://keiyoushi.github.io/extensions/)

**Source Name**
Name of the source

**Kotatsu Link**
Link to the file where the parser is implemented
(e.g. https://github.com/KotatsuApp/kotatsu-parsers/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/koitharu/kotatsu/parsers/site/all/MangaDexParser.kt)

**(Optional) Extension Implementation**
If source has a parser implementation in [Kotatsu](https://github.com/keiyoushi/extensions) and the extension is not included in the [Keiyoushi repo](https://github.com/keiyoushi/extensions) but exists, please provide a link to it.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
